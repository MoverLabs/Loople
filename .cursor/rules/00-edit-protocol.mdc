## How to change code in this repo
- Make the **smallest complete** change that solves the issue.
- **List exact files** you intend to modify before editing.
- When you output a file, **output the entire file** (no ellipses).
- If a change would touch >5 files or cross domains, propose a short plan first.

## Rule behavior
- Prefer **scoped rules** and **Auto Attached** rules elsewhere in this folder.
- Keep content **actionable, <500 lines, and example‑driven**.

## After every change, include “Verify” steps
- Example:
  `Verify: pnpm test -w` then visit `/register` and submit a sample form; expect 200 + row in DB.
